@1   = ~By Moradin's hammer Drizzt! The Nine Hells itself seem to have opened its jaws swallowing Icewind Dale into its dark belly!~
@2   = ~The demonic content seems to appear as a common pattern...~
@3   = ~Demonic or not, who ever is responsible for Catti-Brie being lost will answer with an axe cleaving their skull! I found the dead bodies of the rangers Catti-Brie travelled with though no signs from her except for some small clues leading me to this location. But the tracks end here. We must proceed with haste, I suspect the worst.~
@4   = ~Agreed to that.~
@5   = ~This matter starts to get too much for me to handle, I wish you all good luck. I must take my leave.~
@6   = ~By Moradin's hammer! Seems like the Nine Hells itself has placed itself in Icewind Dale and I fear that Catti-Brie my fosterchild is lost within it. Would you gather your steel and help me finding her?~
@7   = ~I will join the noble cause finding this Catti-Brie.~
@8   = ~I am sorry but other matters call me, farewell.~
