@1   = ~You surely have some filthy foes eagerly minded to end your existence Drizzt. Demons from the Nine Hells long for your blood. I see that you have a companion at your side.~
@2   = ~From a battle with some gnolls who could have guessed that it would lead me into the Nine Hells.~
@3   = ~You there! Draw your steel and aim to bury it into the flesh of these foul demonic beings!~
@4   = ~I am all in for it, let us battle our way out from this hellhole!~
@5   = ~Forget it, this is your fight. To face these demonic beings is equal with death.~
@6   = ~Good speed! They can choose the back of my hand or the tip of my boot!~
@7   = ~You lack the courage and obviously do not deserve to battle side by side with Wulfgar! You are doomed on your own here, and that is your own wish.~
@8   = ~That is a common thing if one takes the adventuring road side by side with Drizzt. Come now let us combine our steel and bury it deep into the flesh of these demonic beings.~
