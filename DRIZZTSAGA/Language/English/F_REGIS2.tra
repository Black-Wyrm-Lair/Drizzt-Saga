@1   = ~Drizzt! I knew that you would dance your way through the outer planes.~
@2   = ~How did you manage to get to Icewind Dale with such haste.~
@3   = ~The same way as you I figure, no less than Elminster of course. We could chatter all day but urgent matters call. Neither Bruenor nor Catti-Brie are to be found and the sun has an unnaturally piercing gaze today. We should check Bruenor's chest to see if perhaps there are any clues to be found.~
@4   = ~Agreed.~
@5   = ~I am afraid that other matters of importance call me and I must take my leave.~
@6   = ~Greetings again. I don't see Drizzt by your side anymore. Surely hope that his boots are on their way here. Urgent matters calls because neither Bruenor nor Catti-Brie are to be found. We should check Bruenor's chest for clues.~
@7   = ~I have other important matters that call me and I must take my leave.~
